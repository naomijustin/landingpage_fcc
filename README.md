## Overview of Project

A landing page to experiment with a bold and vibrant colour palette, new style of composition and test different CSS Animations.

## Process

Initally started with a low fidelity version created in Figma. This progressed to a version that included a limited colour palette.

Once the colour scheme was chosen, I chose a product that felt complimentary to the palette. 
As the colours consisted of warm autumn tones, I chose to go with an autumn clothing service to bulk up wardrobes for the coming months.
